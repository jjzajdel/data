  ## Context:
  
  In the United States, the U.S. Census Bureau defines “deep poverty” as living in a household 
  with a total cash income below 50 percent of its poverty threshold.  The poverty level is set 
  by the U.S Federal Government each year in accordance to household size. In 2021, the poverty 
  level for a household of 4 was $26,500 in annual income. 50% of this level is $13,250 or 
  $36.30 a day.
